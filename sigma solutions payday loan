Why you may want to consider Klarna: If you need to make an online purchase and you’re short on cash, you may be able to use the Klarna shopping app to buy what you need now and pay for it later. When you use the Klarna app to shop at participating online retailers, you’ll get access to exclusive deals and price drop notifications.

Three payment options — You can pay for your purchase in 30 days, in four interest-free payments every two weeks, or over a six- to 36-month period. If you want to finance your purchase, Klarna will check your credit. This will result in a hard inquiry, which can negatively affect your credit scores.
Account linking required — Before you make a purchase, you must link your bank account, debit or credit card to your Klarna account.
Interest charges — Klarna doesn’t charge interest on purchases when you pay in four installments, but the amount you owe will automatically be charged to your debit or credit card. If you link a credit card to your Klarna account and don’t pay your balance on time and in full, you could accrue interest charges from your credit card company. And if you use a debit card, you may pay insufficient funds fees if there’s not enough money in your account to cover your payment. When you use Klarna’s longest financing option, you will be charged interest — but you won’t find out what your rate is until right before you complete your purchase.
Fees — There’s no annual fee to use Klarna, and you won’t be charged a prepayment penalty if you want to repay the amount you owe before it’s due. But if you pay in four installments and Klarna is unable to collect one of your scheduled payments, Klarna will make a second attempt to collect your payment. If that attempt is unsuccessful, it may charge you a late fee of up to $7 and add your missed payment to the next scheduled payment. And if you finance your purchase, you could be on the hook for up to $35 in late fees.
