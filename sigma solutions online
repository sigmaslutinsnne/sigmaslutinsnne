Why you may want to consider MoneyLion: MoneyLion is an app that offers small-dollar loans — up to a maximum amount of $1,000 — that give you a chance to build credit. When you get a credit-builder loan, MoneyLion reports your payments to the three major consumer credit bureaus each month. And you get weekly credit monitoring from TransUnion, so you can see how your payments are affecting your credit scores.

Depending on your finances, you may qualify to receive your full loan amount upfront. Or MoneyLion may give you a portion of the money right away and deposit the rest into an interest-bearing account, which you’ll receive when you pay off the loan.

Fees — To get a credit-builder loan through the MoneyLion app, you must have a Credit Builder Plus membership. The cost of the membership is $19.99 a month, but you can earn rewards to help cover the fee by logging into the app and using a MoneyLion® Visa debit card on purchases over $10.
No credit check — MoneyLion doesn’t review credit history to determine loan eligibility. The company looks at the activity in your primary checking account to decide whether to make you a loan offer.
Interest rate — The annual percentage rate on MoneyLion’s credit-builder loans varies from competitive to high, but even MoneyLion’s highest APR is lower than what you’re likely to pay on a payday loan. And you can repay your loan at any time without incurring a prepayment penalty.
