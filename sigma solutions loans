Why you may want to consider NetCredit: If you need a bigger loan, NetCredit offers online loans to California residents ranging from $2,500 to $10,500. NetCredit performs traditional credit checks during the application process, but it also says it considers factors beyond credit scores before making a loan decision. And the company offers financial education courses to help you improve your financial health if you’ve had credit difficulties in the past.

High rates — Because NetCredit works with people who have bad credit, its APRs are higher than what traditional personal loan lenders charge, but they’re still lower than what you’d typically pay with a payday loan.
Fees — NetCredit doesn’t charge application, origination or insufficient funds fees in California. And you won’t get hit with a prepayment penalty if you decide to pay off your loan early. But if you don’t make your payment within 15 days of the due date, you may be charged a late fee of $15.
Ability to apply for prequalification — You can check your eligibility for a loan with NetCredit without affecting your credit scores. If you qualify, you’ll receive an offer with your estimated rate and loan term options. If you accept the offer, NetCredit will do a hard credit inquiry, which may affect your scores. Just keep in mind that your offer terms can change after prequalification.
Build credit — NetCredit reports your payments to Experian and TransUnion — two of the three major credit bureaus — giving you an opportunity to build your credit with on-time payments.
